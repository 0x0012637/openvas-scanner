	* configure.in, openvas.tmpl.in, openvasd/Makefile: Replace
	use of nessus-libraries and libnasl by openvas-libraries
	and openvas-libnasl. This includes name change of the respective
	variables for the respective config scripts.

	* VERSION: Set back to 0.9.0. OpenVAS wasn't that far yet.

	* openvasd-config.in, configure.in, Makefile: Removed
	DESTDIR. It looks pretty useless as it needs to
	be set in the shell. It was introduced in Nessus 1.3.1.

	* ChangeLog: New. Started ChangeLog file.
