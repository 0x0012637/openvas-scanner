2007-07-20  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* openvasd/openvasd.c (main): Removed HAVE_SSL remains.

	* Makefile: Removed installation of "nessus-services". This module
	does not need to care about libdir (creation removed)

	* TODO: cleaned a bit.

2007-07-18  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* include/includes.h: Remove openssl includes

2007-07-18  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* openvasd/openvas-check-signature.c: Use GnuTLS instead of
	OpenSSL.  See comments in the file for things that could be done
	better.
	(print_tls_error, map_file, hexdecode): New.  Helper functions.
	(generate_signature, verify_signature): Use GnuTLS instead of
	OpenSSL.  Also, both functions now have an additional parameter
	for the keyfile/certfile to use so that their filenames are no
	longer hard wired.
	(main): Add command line arguments to specifiy the key or
	certificat to use when signing or verifying.  Pass those filenames
	to generate_signature and verify_signature.

	* openvasd/plugs_hash.c (plugins_hash): Handle errors from
	gcry_md_open.  plugins_hash may return NULL now.

	* openvasd/comm.c (comm_send_md5_plugins): Handle case where
	plugins_hash returns NULL.

2007-07-02  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* openvasd/plugs_hash.c (file_hash, plugins_hash): Use unsigned
	char (pointer/array) to hold the digest to avoid warnings about
	type mismatch.

2007-07-02  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* openvasd/openvasd.c: Use the libopenvas ssl abstraction instead

	(ovas_server_ctx): Introduced instead of ssl_mt and ssl_ctx
	(server_thread): Use the libopenvas ssl abstraction instead of

2007-05-09  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>
