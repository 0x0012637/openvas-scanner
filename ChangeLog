2007-07-25  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	nasl_no_signature_checks to yes, because the signatures
	are currently not present.

	* INSTALL: just slight correction and attached a warning
	that this is outdated.

2007-07-21  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* MANIFEST: updated.

2007-07-20  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	Remove support for Unix Sockets for communication between client and
	server. Since SSL support is present, this is not needed anymore for
	security reasons. Considerable performance loss is not expected, only
	at first connection time it might be faster with unix sockets (which
	is not really for sure since the loopback device is also very fast).
	Also, the implementation is suboptimal anyway because it works
	as compile-time option. It is very easy to select between a
	unix domain socket and inet socket at runtime.

	* configure.in: Removed unix-socket handling.

	* configure: updated.

	* include/config.h.in, openvasd/sighand.c, openvasd/preferences.c,
	openvasd/openvasd.c, openvasd/ntp_11.c, openvasd/hosts.c:
	Removed any handling of unix
	sockets (this also removes any occurance of USE_AF_UNIX,
	OPENVAS_ON_SSL, AF_UNIX_PATH, USE_AF_INET, AD_UNIX)

	* openvasd/comm.c: Remove handling for non-SSL conncetions.

2007-07-20  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* CHANGES: Updated with some notes.

2007-07-20  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* openvasd/openvasd.c (main): Removed HAVE_SSL remains.

	* Makefile: Removed installation of "nessus-services". This module
	does not need to care about libdir (creation removed)

	* TODO: cleaned a bit.

2007-07-18  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* include/includes.h: Remove openssl includes

2007-07-18  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* openvasd/openvas-check-signature.c: Use GnuTLS instead of
	OpenSSL.  See comments in the file for things that could be done
	better.
	(print_tls_error, map_file, hexdecode): New.  Helper functions.
	(generate_signature, verify_signature): Use GnuTLS instead of
	OpenSSL.  Also, both functions now have an additional parameter
	for the keyfile/certfile to use so that their filenames are no
	longer hard wired.
	(main): Add command line arguments to specifiy the key or
	certificat to use when signing or verifying.  Pass those filenames
	to generate_signature and verify_signature.

2007-07-04  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* openvasd/plugs_hash.c (plugins_hash): Handle errors from
	gcry_md_open.  plugins_hash may return NULL now.

	* openvasd/comm.c (comm_send_md5_plugins): Handle case where
	plugins_hash returns NULL.

2007-07-02  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* openvasd/plugs_hash.c (file_hash, plugins_hash): Use unsigned
	char (pointer/array) to hold the digest to avoid warnings about
	type mismatch.

2007-07-02  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* openvasd/md5.c, openvasd/md5.c: removed. no longer needed.

	* openvasd/Makefile: md5.c has been removed.

	* openvasd/comm.c: Do not included md5.h.  it wasn't needed anyway

2007-07-02  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* openvasd/users.c remove includes of openssl headers.
	(check_user): Use libgcrypt to compute md5 sums.

	* openvasd/plugs_hash.c (md5sum_hex): New function to convert a
	binary md5 sum to hexadecimal.
	(file_hash, dir_plugins_hash, plugins_hash): Use libgcrypt to
	compute md5 sums.

2007-07-02  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* openvasd/openvasd.c: Use the libopenvas ssl abstraction instead
	of openssl. As a consequence the ssl_cipher_list config option is
	no longer supported.
	(ssl_mt, ssl_ctx): Removed.
	(ovas_server_ctx): Introduced instead of ssl_mt and ssl_ctx
	(server_thread): Use the libopenvas ssl abstraction instead of
	openssl.
	(verify_callback): removed. verification is done in libopenvas.
	(main_loop): Use the libopenvas ssl abstraction instead of
	openssl.

2007-07-02  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* openvasd/preferences.c: Always compile in
	preferences_get_string, i.e. do not depend on OPENVAS_ON_SSL being
	defined.

2007-06-22  Bernhard Herzog  <bh@intevation.de>

	* include/config.h, include/corevers.h: Removed from SVN because
	they're automatically generated by the configure script

	* configure, include/config.h, include/corevers.h: Updated.

2007-05-25  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* include/ntcompat.h: Removed. Renamed to threadcompat.h
	because in fact it is about threads.

	* include/threadcompat.h: New. Previous ntcompat.h.

	* Makefile, MANIFEST, include/includes.h: Renamed ntcompat.h
	to threadcompat.h

2007-05-25  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	openvasd/preferences.c: Replaced print_error by printf.

2007-05-25  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>

	* configure.in, openvas.tmpl.in, openvasd/Makefile: Replace
	use of nessus-libraries and libnasl by openvas-libraries
	and openvas-libnasl. This includes name change of the respective
	variables for the respective config scripts.

2007-05-09  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@intevation.de>
