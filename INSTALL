Installing OpenVAS :

ATTENTION: The description has not been reworked
so far.


The usual sequence of 

./configure && make && make install

works in principle.

Then :

- create a certificate for openvasd, using openvas-mkcert(8)
- add a user, using openvas-adduser(8)
- start openvasd (8)
- start openvas-client and connect to it, as the username you specified
