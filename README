Compiling openvas-server
------------------------

Before compiling openvas-server make sure that you installed openvas-libraries
and openvas-libnasl.

Run

$ ./configure

to set up the compilation envoironment.
During configuration, error messages may show up if openvas-libraries,
openvas-libnasl or other libraries and applications needed to compile
openvas-server are not present on your system or do not meet the version
requirements.
In this case, resolve the issues reported and run configure again.

If you want to install openvas-server into a different hierarchy, you may
want to use the prefix option during configuration:

$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/openvas

More information about the configuration options is available through the help
option:

$ ./configure --help

Once you have configured openvas-server successfully, you can start the
compilation by executing the following command:

$ make

To install openvas-server, you can use the following command:

$ make install

Please note that you may have to execute this command as root, especially if you
have specified a prefix for which your user does not have full permissions.

Setting up openvas-server
-------------------------
Setting up an openvas-server requires following steps.

1) Create a certificate for the openvas-server daemon openvasd, using openvas-mkcert(8).
2) Add user(s), using openvas-adduser(8). User- accounts will be needed to
connect to the server with a Client.
3) Start openvasd. The most important command-line options are -p <portnumber> and
-D to run in daemon mode. Invoke openvasd --help to find out about others.
4) If you want to test your setup, start an openvas-client and connect to the
server. You will need username and password as specified in step 2.
5) If you do not have plugins (NVTs) installed, consider using the plugin feed.
More information can be found on the OpenVAS- website.
6) If you installed new plugins make sure that the paths in
($PREFIX)/etc/openvas/openvasd.conf are set up correctly and restart openvasd.

If you encounter problems it can be helpful to inspect and make copies of
($PREFIX)/var/log/openvasd.messages and ($PREFIX)/var/log/openvasd.dump .
Provide extracts of these files when contacting the mailinglists, people in
the IRC channel #openvas or reporting a bug on the openvas bugtracker
(http://bugs.openvas.org) and it will be appreciated.
