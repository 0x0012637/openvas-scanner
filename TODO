Some old entries:

- replace the arglists by harglists. That is, replace linked 
  lists by hashtables. All the functions are here, it's just
  a matter of search/replace thing. 
  Read /usr/local/include/openvas/harglsts.h for details
  about the harglsts

- memory leaks in plugins reload
- Need to fix url in "debian/download-release.sh line ~18. 
  Do we need debian/new-packages.sh at the moment? 
  (Maybe adapt it to work for openvas) 
- Fix the plugin feed instructions in doc/openvas-fetch.1
