What must be done :		(feel free to volunteer)


  On the server side :

  	- replace the arglists by harglists. That is, replace linked 
	  lists by hashtables. All the functions are here, it's just
	  a matter of search/replace thing. 
	  Read /usr/local/include/nessus/harglsts.h for details
	  about the harglsts

	- memory leaks in plugins reload
	- Need to fix url in "debian/download-release.sh line ~18. 
	  Do we need debian/new-packages.sh at the moment? 
	  (Maybe adapt it to work for openvas) 
	- Fix the plugin feed instructions in doc/openvas-fetch.1
