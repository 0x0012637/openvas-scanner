	* Analyse/discuss in detail whether it makes send to keep the feature to
	upload plugins. It looks like a serious security problem to allow this.

	* Analyse/discuss in detail whether it still makes sense to manage
	a cache of parsed plugins. It looks like this does not gain anything
	in regard of performance or storage but in the same time adding
	comlexity.

Some old entries:

- replace the arglists by harglists. That is, replace linked 
  lists by hashtables. All the functions are here, it's just
  a matter of search/replace thing. 
  Read /usr/local/include/openvas/harglsts.h for details
  about the harglsts

- memory leaks in plugins reload
- Need to fix url in "debian/download-release.sh line ~18. 
  Do we need debian/new-packages.sh at the moment? 
  (Maybe adapt it to work for openvas)
