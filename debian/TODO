- We should strive to make it possible to merge the following
  when configuring the package so that users are not shown the 
  configuration prompt from dpkg:

#
# Added by openvas-mkcert
#
cert_file=/var/lib/nessus/CA/servercert.pem
key_file=/var/lib/nessus/private/CA/serverkey.pem
ca_file=/var/lib/nessus/CA/cacert.pem
# If you decide to protect your private key with a password,
# uncomment and change next line
# pem_password=password
# If you want to force the use of a client certificate, uncomment next line
# force_pubkey_auth = yes
