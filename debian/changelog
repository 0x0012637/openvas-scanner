nessus-core (2.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #287505)
    - The upload function is no longer present in the GUI (Closes: #239638)
    - Error messages now have a proper window (Closes: #264109)
  * Have nessus-mkcert-client warn if the server certificates cannot
    be read (happens when you are not root)
  * Improved the nessus.initd so that it will check if the (expected)
    certificates are available before running Nessusd.
  * Make the reload action wait a little bit for the pid file to
    be created, otherwise it will always return with an ERROR.
  * Fixed Makefile so nessus-fetch is cleaned properly and so that
    nessus-fetch manpage is installed with the package.
  * Small change to nessus-fetch manpage to point admins to change
    the configuration file in NESSUS_CONFDIR (/etc/nessusd/ in Debian)
  * Relocate nessus-fetch, nessus-mkrand and nessus-check-signature
    to their appropiate location, the nessusd package
  * Added a new script (new-packages.sh) which is the one I currently use
    to build new releases of the packages.
  * Have the init.d script redirect all stdout to /dev/null to prevent
    the GPL feed error warning from showing if using the init.d script
  * Modified the postinst script so that the nessusd daemon will be
    restarted on upgrade (if running)

nessus-core (2.2.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the mistaken comment in nessusd.conf regarding
    nasl_no_signature_checks. I actually didn't read it properly when 
    introducing it. Also, added comments in the README file regarding
    local security checks.
    This was actually fixed a while back, but not yet uploaded.
    (Closes: #286660, #287568)
  * The init.d script now checks if Nessus was properly started 
    (yells otherwise). More explicitly, it will check if you've run
    nessus-mkcerts (have ca_file in your nessusd.conf) and warn otherwise 
    (Closes: #289703)
  * Also added a 'status' call in the init.d file.
  * Added a debian/TODO

nessus-core (2.2.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

nessus-core (2.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Created /var/lib/nessus/tmp for the nessus daemon to be able to run
    local security checks (Closes: #281471)
  * Fixed nessusd.conf max_threads -> max_checks (Closes: #281888)
  * Close filehandles 0, 1 and 2 when running with -D. This prevents
    ssh sessions from being blocked (Closes: #177237)
  * Added additional missing parameters to the default nessusd.conf 
    file (in most cases commented out) so that the administrator can
    adjust at will. Some of these parameters are not documented in the
    nessusd manpage, but further information is available in Edgeo's
    Nessus Knowledge Base at http://www.edgeos.com/nessuskb/

nessus-core (2.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Use -q in the init.d script of nessusd so it will not list all the
    plugins that are loaded.

nessus-core (2.0.12-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed FTBFS due to relocation changes made in previous version,
    modified the way the package is configured and installed in order to
    avoid this issue in the future.  (Closes: #278760)
  * Added a force_stop() subroutine in nessusd's rc. Since nessusd is 
    not started by default, it will not be stopped on package upgrades
    and the --exec option of start-stop-daemon will make it think that
    stop is not started (when it is). To avoid this, the process is checked
    to see if its running (reusing some of sysklogd's code) if the PIDFILE exists,
    it is verified and it is forced to stop.

nessus-core (2.0.12-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set rootdir and makebin_dir when distcleaning just in case
    (nessus.tmpl might not be available at that point) and also
    fixed Makefile so it will not try to execute dangerous operations
    if variables are undefined (Closes: #274193)

  * Removed mentions to GTK+ 1.2 in control file (Closes: #264105)
  * Conflict against the version in experimental since the 2.1.0 libraries
    are not compatible but soname is the same (Closes: #260604)
  * Remove archtable kludge from dpkg and use the more sensible approach
    proposed by Robert Millan (Closes: #266879)

nessus-core (2.0.10a-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified logrotate script in order to have all log files mode 640 since
  they might contain sensitive information (i.e. systems that are vulnerable
  to some attacks)

nessus-core (2.0.10a-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Introduced code in configure.in to detect system os and architecture
  (based on dpkg's code) and use that to avoid -O flags when compiling
  in arm. That should fix the build errors that are preventing the
  package from propagating into testing. I'm reporting the bug
  nevertheless.

nessus-core (2.0.10a-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #230057)
  * Added the init.d script to conffiles.
  * Added the menu icon patch provided by Christian Perrier which has 
    been waiting in the BTS for some time (Closes: #209313)
  * Remove rc.d links on purge
  * Now removes on purge all the var files this avoids the problem of
    having the user purge, then reinstall and not have a valid
    configuration (since it's missing the ca_file definition in 
    nessusd.conf) A probable move in the future will be to
    move all the config data created with nessus-mkcert and nessus-adduser
    to the configuration and have nessus-mkcert add the CA file to
    nessusd.conf if it already exists (Closes: #231097)

nessus-core (2.0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream release (Closes: #220001).
  * Pid file moved to /var/run (introduced NESSUS_PIDDIR configuration
    value) and changed all the debian/ files (init.d and logrotate) as
    well as configure.in, nessus.tmpl and nessusd/utils.c (Closes: #178098)
  * Moved the nessus-mkcert-client script and manpage to nessusd 
    (Closes: #202357)
  * Fixed nessus-mkcert-client to use emailAddress in the certificate
    as suggested by Raul Hernandez (Closes: #223154, #223158)
  * The init.d script is now installed but it's not enabled so Nessus
    will not be started on startup (but will be stopped if running) 
    in order to avoid potential security holes. This provides, however
    an easy way for administrators to start/stop nessus (instead
    of killing the daemon directly). So now we call update-rc.d 
    to create the 'stop' links in the postinst and remove the links
    in postrm. Also, the init.d script is the best way now to stop
    the daemon (in prerm)  (Closes: #110394)

nessus (0.0.alpha2-fix4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (thanks, Javier!).
  * New upstream version (this number allows future 1.0 etc).
  * Separated the binaries in two packages: the client which depends
    on GTK+, and the server with plugins and the support libraries.
  * Doesn't build static libraries anymore. Removed the .so symlinks.
  * Added libtool rpath workaround and some other fixes in configure.in.
  * Using completely new debian/* files, fully extended with debhelper.
  * Package goes to non-US, because of the encryption libraries used.
  * Now Policy 3.x compliant, uses FHS et al.
  * Now uses /etc/nessus/ for config files, and /var/log/nessus/ for
    log files. Required changes in the upstream build system
    (configure.in, Makefile, etc).
  * TODO: investigate whether src/libpcap/tcp_* files make much difference
    between default libpcap.so and this custom libpcap-nessus.so.
