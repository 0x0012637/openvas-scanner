Description: Remote network security auditor, the client
 The Nessus Security Scanner is a security auditing tool. It makes
 possible to test security modules in an attempt to find vulnerable
 spots that should be fixed.
 .
 It is made up of two parts: a server, and a client. The server/daemon,
 openvasd, is in charge of the attacks, whereas the client, nessus,
 provides the user a nice X11/GTK+ interface.
 .
 This package contains the GTK+ client, which exists in other
 forms and on other platforms, too.
