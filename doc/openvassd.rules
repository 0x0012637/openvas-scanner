# OpenVAS Scanner rules for accessing target hosts
#
# This file determines the access/deny rules on which
# hosts are allowed to contact by the scanner.
# No other setting can work around this rule set.
# But the list can be further reduced by the client
# in order to prevent accidental scanning of hosts
# that should not be touched.
#
# This file is usually installed as /etc/openvas/openvassd.rules
#

# Syntax : accept|reject address/netmask

# Accept to scan any host: 

default accept
