OpenVAS Message Translations
============================

Updating the message catalogs currently only works on unix-like systems
and requires xgettext 0.14.
There is one so-called text domains, 'openvas-scripts' which are
the administration shell-script for the OpenVAS Server.

OpenVAS Admin Scripts (text domain 'openvas-scripts')
---------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, for shell scripts the updating process does
not work automatically. Even the initial preparation was
largly handcrafted after these steps did some automatic
extraction (sample for adduser):
xgettext -d openvas-scripts -s -o openvas-scripts.pot -L Shell openvas-adduser.in
msginit -l de_DE -o openvas-scripts-de.po -i openvas-scripts.pot

To just install the german translation (this will automatically
create the gmo file):

	$ make install-openvas-scripts
