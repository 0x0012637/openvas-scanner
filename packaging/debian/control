Description: Remote network security auditor, the server
 The OpenVAS Security Scanner is a security auditing tool. It makes
 possible to test security modules in an attempt to find vulnerable
 spots that should be fixed.
 .
 It is made up of two parts: a server, and a client. The server/daemon,
 openvasd, is in charge of the attacks, whereas the client,
 OpenVAS-Client, provides the user a nice X11/GTK+ interface.
 .
 This package contains the server.
